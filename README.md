# sports-products-sales-analysis
This is a project about building a dashboard showcasing the key insights of sports products sales sold by retailers in different locations
The dataset used for this project is from FP20 Analytics datasets.

## Key Insights
1. West Gear is the highest profited retailer by selling 32% more than Amazon (the least profited).
2. Men's street footwear are the being sold 66% more than women's street footwear even though men's are costly, so having a little bit of high prices for men's would benefit.
3. Most of the sales are happening in states with more number of universities so having a Instore stock in this area would benefit.
